# UI Components

Core reusable UI components implementing the SwS design system.

## Components

### Button.astro
Primary interactive component with three variants:
- `primary` - Main call-to-action (purple background)
- `secondary` - Secondary actions (purple border)
- `ghost` - Minimal text-only actions

### Card.astro
Flexible container component for content blocks:
- `default` - Standard content cards
- `featured` - Highlighted content with enhanced styling
- `compact` - Minimal spacing for dense layouts

### Hexagon.astro
Signature brand element representing pods and scientific structure:
- CSS-based clip-path for optimal performance
- Multiple size and color variants
- Used throughout the platform for visual consistency

## Design System Adherence

All components follow the refined design specifications:
- Exact color palette (#bd00ff primary, #0a0a0a background, etc.)
- Generous spacing system (8px to 120px scale)
- Subtle transitions (200-300ms duration)
- WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility compliance
