## The Challenge

Every year, millions of patients with rare diseases face a "diagnostic odyssey" - years of tests, misdiagnoses, and uncertainty. The average rare disease patient waits 4.8 years for an accurate diagnosis, visiting 7.3 different physicians.

## Our Approach

We're building AI models that can:
- Analyze medical images for subtle patterns humans might miss
- Cross-reference symptoms with genomic data
- Connect patients with similar undiagnosed conditions
- Provide doctors with ranked differential diagnoses

## Impact So Far

- **300+** rare conditions in our database
- **45%** reduction in time to diagnosis for pilot participants
- **12** medical centers participating
- **2,000+** patients helped

## Get Involved

Whether you're a data scientist, medical professional, or patient advocate, there's a role for you in this project. Together, we're shortening the diagnostic odyssey.
