## Discovering Nature's Quantum Computer

Plants achieve 95% efficiency in converting light to chemical energy - far exceeding our best solar panels. The secret? Quantum coherence that allows energy to explore all possible pathways simultaneously.

## Research Goals

1. Map quantum states in photosynthetic complexes
2. Understand coherence at room temperature
3. Design bio-inspired quantum solar cells
4. Create educational materials for quantum biology

## Breakthrough Findings

Our team has discovered that plants maintain quantum coherence for up to 300 femtoseconds at room temperature - challenging everything we thought we knew about quantum decoherence.

## Applications

- Next-generation solar panels with 90%+ efficiency
- Quantum computers that operate at room temperature
- New understanding of life's fundamental processes
