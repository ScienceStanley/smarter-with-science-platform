## Why This Matters

Our oceans are the lungs of our planet, yet coral reefsâ€”home to 25% of marine speciesâ€”are disappearing at an alarming rate. Traditional conservation methods can't scale fast enough. That's where our community comes in.

## The Challenge

Climate change and human activities are bleaching coral reefs faster than they can recover. Marine biologists need tools to:
- Monitor reef health at scale
- Predict bleaching events before they occur
- Guide restoration efforts with data-driven precision
- Engage local communities in conservation

## Our Approach

We're building an AI system that combines:

### Computer Vision Analysis
- Underwater camera networks capturing reef health in real-time
- Machine learning models trained on thousands of coral images
- Automated detection of bleaching, disease, and recovery patterns

### Community Data Collection
- Mobile apps for citizen scientists and local divers
- Integration with existing marine monitoring programs
- Training workshops for coastal communities

### Predictive Modeling
- Environmental data fusion (temperature, pH, currents)
- Early warning systems for bleaching events
- Restoration site optimization algorithms

## Current Progress

- **Phase 1 Complete**: Computer vision model achieving 94% accuracy in coral health classification
- **Phase 2 Active**: Deploying camera networks in 3 reef systems across the Pacific
- **Phase 3 Planning**: Community engagement platform launch in Q4 2024

## How You Can Contribute

Whether you're a marine biologist, AI researcher, coastal community member, or just passionate about ocean conservation:

- **Data Scientists**: Help improve our ML models
- **Marine Biologists**: Validate our findings and guide research priorities
- **Community Members**: Participate in data collection and reef monitoring
- **Developers**: Contribute to our open-source platform

## Impact Metrics

- **Reefs Monitored**: 12 sites across 3 ocean regions
- **Data Points Collected**: 50,000+ coral health assessments
- **Community Volunteers**: 200+ active contributors
- **Early Warnings Issued**: 8 successful bleaching predictions
