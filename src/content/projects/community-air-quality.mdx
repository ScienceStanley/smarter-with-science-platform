## Why This Matters

Low-income communities face disproportionate exposure to air pollution, but often lack the data to advocate for change. We're changing that with affordable, accurate air quality monitoring.

## The Network

- **150+** sensors deployed across 12 neighborhoods
- **Real-time** data accessible to all residents
- **Mobile alerts** for pollution spikes
- **Historical data** for policy advocacy

## Community Impact

Residents have used our data to:
- Stop a proposed waste facility near schools
- Secure funding for green barriers along highways
- Create "clean air routes" for student walking paths
- Advocate for stricter emissions standards

## Join the Network

Build a sensor for ~$30, contribute to open-source code, or help analyze data. Science by the people, for the people.
